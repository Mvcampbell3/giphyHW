## Version 2.005
 
Yes we went backwards a little bit

### In transistion
- Trying to implement local storage
- Changed the way the buttons are loaded to the screen

### Needed:
- Have different classes for buttons based on if saved to local storage or not?
- Instead of just appending to html, push to showButtons then append that to html?
- Delete button that works on screen and local storage
- Save button that adds button text to the buttons JSON file
